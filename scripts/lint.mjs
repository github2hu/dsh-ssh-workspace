/**
 * Syntax-check every module this package ships or runs.
 *
 * `node --check` only parses; it never executes, imports or resolves anything.
 * That makes it the one check that is safe to run against a module whose peers
 * are not installed — which is exactly the situation in a bare checkout and in
 * CI, where the `@deepseek-ai/*` tree is deliberately absent.
 *
 * Scope is deliberate:
 *  - `lib/` and `scripts/` are shipped or run by users;
 *  - `tests/` is not shipped, but a syntax error there turns a suite into a
 *    crash in CI, and the crash is easy to mistake for a real failure.
 *
 * The CI workflow used to inline a `for f in lib/*.js` loop. It now calls this
 * script so the file list lives in one place instead of three (ci.yml,
 * release.yml and docs/development.md all describe the same command).
 *
 * Run: node scripts/lint.mjs
