/**
 * Dependency declarations, and the resolution those declarations feed.
 *
 * Declaring the Host packages as `peerDependencies` is NOT enough, and this is
 * the trap this suite exists for: npm 7+ auto-installs a declared peer it cannot
 * find. Without `peerDependenciesMeta`, installing this package pulls in a
 * private copy of the whole Host, and the plugin then loads a second Cordis and
 * a second `dsh-fs` instead of the running Host's: two service registries, split
 * instances — the exact failure the peers exist to prevent.
 *
 * `peerDependenciesMeta.<name>.optional` suppresses that: the install then
 * contains this plugin, the ssh2 runtime tree, and no `@deepseek-ai` at all. The
 * declaration is pinned here so a future edit cannot quietly restore the
 * auto-install.
 *
 * The peers are also read by the Host, not just by the package manager: `app-boot`
 * uses `peerDependencies["@deepseek-ai/dsh"]` as the version gate when a manifest
 * has no top-level `engines.dsh`, and `readPeerNames`/`routeLinked` uses this
 * manifest's peer list to decide whether a linked plugin's Host imports route to
 * the running Host. Deleting the peers to "clean up" would remove both.
 *
 * The suite also pins the counterpart decision: `ssh2` is this plugin's OWN
 * dependency, declared in `dependencies` and left to the package manager that
 * installs this package. Nothing here checks whether the user has it — under
 * npm, pnpm and yarn the install supplies it, and when it is genuinely missing
 * the resolution error says so. There is deliberately no runtime installer.
 *
 * Run: node tests/peers-smoke.mjs
